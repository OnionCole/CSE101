SPECIAL NOTE TO PROF/GRADER:
I believe that I have found an inconsistency between the project document and the grading tests
		for this assignment. In the document it states, "the set of 'mathematical structures' for 
		this ADT consists of all finite sequences of integers in which at most one element is 
		underscored." This seems to state that the cursor is part of the state. The 'equals'
		method is supposed to compare state, which means that it should compare the cursor.
		However, the equals test is used in the tests for the insert and copy methods to check
		correctness. With the copy method in particular, the cursor is supposed to be undefined
		in the copy, but the equals test is then used to test the return of the copy method
		against a List with the cursor defined. I altered my equals method to pass the tests, but
		its execution deviates from what the document suggests it should be.
